# Romanian Whist on the web: implementation plan

> **Status: proposal, 2026-10-27. Nothing here is built yet.**
>
> The plan spans two repositories. Phase 0 changes this engine. Every later phase builds a new
> repository, `romanian_whist_web`, which takes the engine as a submodule, the way the terminal and
> desktop clients do. The plan lives here because the engine is what every client shares, and
> phase 0 is engine work.

This plan is for whoever builds it: the owner, or an agent picking the work up cold. It says what
to build, which existing code each part comes from, in what order, and how to tell each phase is
done. Decisions that are still the owner's are collected in
[section 15](#15-decisions-with-defaults), each with the default this plan assumes until he says
otherwise. When a phase is finished, its outcome is written under it, as the desktop client's
redesign plan does.

**Read first, in this order**

1. This file, once, top to bottom.
2. This repository's [README](../README.md), above all "Round types and who may see a hand" and
   "Threading, stopping, and failure". The server described here is the networked client those
   sections were written for.
3. The desktop client's `docs/QT_CLIENT_PLAN_proposal1.md`: §§3–6 (the game thread, the bridge,
   the move provider, shutdown) and §9 (the snapshot question phase 0 settles). The server repeats
   that design, with a WebSocket where the desktop client has a window.
4. The desktop client itself, because the page must look like it: run it, or look at the pictures
   its `tests/ScreenshotTool.cpp` takes. Then its `docs/ui-redesign/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, whose
   phase outcomes record where the desktop client departed from its mock-up,
   `docs/ui-redesign/mockup/romanian_whist_table.html`. The mock-up's code is a head start and no
   more: wherever it and the desktop client differ, the desktop client wins
   ([§8.1](#81-the-look-the-desktop-client-wins)).

## 1. Summary

**What.** Romanian Whist in a browser, in two modes:

- **Solo:** you against computer players, with everything the desktop client offers: 2 to 6
  seats, the nine computer players, both game shapes, Forehead and Hidden rounds, pacing, fixed
  deals, watching a game of computer players, English and Romanian.
- **Online:** a player creates a table and shares a link, and others join it. Any seat can be a
  human or a computer player. When a human drops out, a computer player takes over their seat, and
  hands it back when they return.

**How.** One C++ server, built on [Drogon](https://github.com/drogonframework/drogon), runs every
game, solo games included. Each game runs the engine on a thread of its own, as the desktop client
does, and talks to the browsers over one WebSocket per browser tab, in JSON. The page in the browser
is written in TypeScript and looks like the desktop client. The mock-up's HTML, CSS and script are
reused only where they already match the desktop client. The page applies no rule of the game: what
it may show, and what the player may do, come from the server.

**Six rules.** Each later section works out one of these.

1. **The engine is read only on its game thread.** What leaves that thread is a snapshot, already
   filtered for whoever will see it.
2. **A card a player may not see never leaves the server.** The engine filters hands per viewer
   before anything is serialised ([§3.1](#31-e1-a-snapshot-filtered-for-its-viewer)).
3. **Every seat has a computer player behind it from the first deal.** A human seat's computer
   player watches the whole game and decides only while its human is gone. That is the whole of
   "a dropped player is replaced" ([§5](#5-drops-replacement-and-reconnection)).
4. **Every wait has a deadline or a cancel.** No player, connection or bug can stall a table
   ([§4.6](#46-threads-and-locks)).
5. **Events animate; snapshots are the truth.** Each game message carries the whole state after
   the event, as that viewer may see it. The page animates the event, then shows the state. It
   never works state out for itself.
6. **The desktop client decides how the page looks.** Where the desktop client and the mock-up
   differ, the desktop client wins, even when that means writing new code instead of reusing the
   mock-up's ([§8.1](#81-the-look-the-desktop-client-wins)).

**Order of work.** The engine first (phase 0). Then the server and a plain debug page, until solo
play, online play, drops and reconnection all work (phases 1–5). Then the desktop client's look
(phases 6–8), then deployment (phase 9). An offline solo mode and game records are optional extras
(phases 10–11). [Section 13](#13-phases) has the phases.

## 2. What is being built

### 2.1 Carried over from the desktop client

| Desktop client | Web |
|---|---|
| 2–6 seats | Same, solo and online |
| Nine computer players: Random, First card, Low risk, Ducking, Cyborg, Reckoner Alpha to Delta | Same, chosen per seat |
| Play, or watch computer players | Solo: both. Online: everyone plays (spectators later, [§2.3](#23-not-in-the-first-version)) |
| 1-8-1 and 8-1-8 | Same |
| Forehead and Hidden rounds: one of each at the end, or every one-card round Forehead | Same |
| Rules enforced: illegal cards greyed out, the forbidden bid unavailable | Same, from the server's prompt |
| Scoreboard with the RUN column, round sheet, round history, last trick, final results | Same |
| Bot speed (five stops, Slow to Instant), "Wait for me after each round" | Bot speed: per table, applied by the server. The wait: solo as on the desktop; online it becomes the round hold ([§4.8](#48-pacing-the-round-hold-and-pause)) |
| Animation speed (Off to Slow) | Per viewer, applied by the page |
| Pause | Solo only |
| Fixed deals (a seed) | Solo only. Online, a seed would reveal the deal ([§9](#9-security-and-fairness)) |
| English and Romanian | Same, chosen by each viewer |
| Seat portraits and computer players' names from the catalogues | Same catalogues: `avatars.json`, `player_names.json` |

### 2.2 New for the web

- **Online tables.** Create a table, share its link or six-character code, wait in the table's
  lobby, and start once every seat is a human or a computer player.
- **Mixed seats.** Any seat can be a human or a computer player, with the computer player chosen
  per seat, as in the desktop client's New Game.
- **Replacement.** A human who drops is replaced by a computer player after a grace period, and
  gets the seat back on returning. The table chooses which computer player; the default is
  Reckoner Beta.
- **A turn timer** online. A connected player who does not move in time has that one move made
  for them.
- **Resuming after a reload**, solo and online.
- **Each viewer in their own language** at a shared table. The protocol carries data, never
  sentences.

### 2.3 Not in the first version

- **Accounts and passwords.** A player is a display name and a random token kept in the browser
  ([§9](#9-security-and-fairness)).
- **A public list of tables.** Tables are private; you join by link or code.
- **Spectators** at someone else's table, **chat** and **rankings**.
- **A layout for phones held upright.** Phones held sideways work
  ([§8.10](#810-keyboard-screen-readers-touch-and-small-screens)).
- **Taking a computer player's seat** in a game that has already started, other than reclaiming
  your own. The seat drivers make it cheap to add later ([§5.5](#55-edge-cases)).
- **Offline play and game records:** optional phases 10 and 11.

---

## 3. Phase 0: the engine's part

Two changes are needed (E1, E2), one is optional (E3), and four things the engine might seem to
need, it does not ([§3.4](#34-what-the-engine-does-not-need)).

### 3.1 E1: a snapshot filtered for its viewer

Two clients keep their own copies of the snapshot code today: the terminal's `GameView` and the
desktop client's `GameSnapshot` with `refreshFromEngine()`. The desktop plan's §9 left open
whether the half that is read straight from the engine belongs in the engine, and recommended
promoting it once there were two real implementations to compare. A third client settles it.

Add to the engine a plain-data `romanian_whist::GameSnapshot` (header `romanian_whist/Snapshot.h`)
and

```cpp
GameSnapshot snapshotFrom(const GameEngine& engine, std::optional<Seat> viewer);
```

**The viewer is a parameter so that a snapshot built without deciding who will see it cannot be
written.** This is the README's own advice to a networked client ("route every hand read through
the viewer"), moved into the engine where every client gets it. `std::nullopt` is a spectator, who
sees no hand at all: the desktop client's rule for a watched game.

The fields are the left column of the desktop plan's §9 table, with the traps the desktop client
found on the way:

| Field | Read from | Note |
|---|---|---|
| status, phase | `getStatus()`, `getPhase()` | The phase as the engine reports it, never inferred |
| round index and count, trick count, trick number, round type | the matching accessors | Index 0-based; clients add 1 to display it |
| trump | `getCurrentTrumpCard()` | Empty in 8-card rounds |
| round leader | `getRoundLeaderSeat()` | Bidding order runs from here |
| active seat | `getActiveSeat()` | Empty between turns |
| forbidden bid | `getForbiddenBet()` | Public: anyone can work it out from the bids |
| cards on the table, each with its seat and whether it is winning | `getCurrentTrick()`, `getCurrentTrickLeader()` | "Winning" is the engine's ranking, never recomputed |
| who led this trick, the suit led | the trick's first card; `getTrickLeaderSeat()` only while the trick is empty | By `onTrickWon()`, `getTrickLeaderSeat()` has moved to the winner (desktop `Snapshot.cpp`, `rebuildTable()`) |
| per seat: name, bidding order, bid (optional), tricks won, cards left, round score, total score, win and loss streaks | the matching accessors | |
| per seat: hand, in the engine's order | `Player::getHand()`, **only when `canSeeHand(viewer, seat)`** | Absent, not present and flagged hidden. The only place in the function that reads a hand |
| bids placed, their sum | derived from the bids | |

Left out: anything about display (the order a hand is shown in, wording, highlights) and anything
the engine does not model (which seats are human, connections, portraits). Hand order stays with
the clients, as the desktop plan's §9 decided.

Keep it plain data and copyable: clients hand it to other threads. `Seat` has no default
constructor, so seats inside the snapshot are optionals or plain indices. No JSON: the engine
takes no dependencies.

**Tests**, in this repository:

- Pinned values at known points of a seeded game: after `start()`, mid-bidding, mid-trick, inside
  `onTrickWon()`, after the last round is scored. This is the test the desktop plan's §9 proposed.
- **The leak test.** A property test over many seeded games, at every table size, with Forehead
  and Hidden rounds: at every observer callback, for every viewer (each seat, and the spectator),
  every hand in the snapshot belongs to a seat that viewer may see by `canSeeHand()`, and the
  viewer's own hand is there exactly when `canSeeHand(viewer, viewer)` is true.
- Inside `onTrickWon()`, the table still holds the finished trick, and "led by" names who led it,
  not who won it.

**Release:** additive, so 5.1.0, with a CHANGELOG entry and a README section, "Snapshots for
another thread or another machine", next to the threading section's own `snapshotFrom` sketch.
The desktop and terminal clients are not asked to switch. They can adopt it when it suits them;
the desktop client's `tests/SnapshotTests.cpp` is what would show that the two agree.

### 3.2 E2: strategies standing in for a seat they do not play

The server gives every human seat a computer player that watches the whole game and decides only
while its human is gone ([§5](#5-drops-replacement-and-reconnection)). That relies on something the
code already does but the documentation does not promise: **a Cyborg or a Reckoner given a seat
with `setSeat()` and registered as an observer before `start()` can be asked for a bid or a card at
any point in any round**, including partway through a round in which it made none of that seat's
earlier decisions.

Why it already holds:

- Both strategies learn the game only through the observer callbacks: round starts, every seat's
  bids, every card played, every trick won. A bid the human made reaches the stand-in exactly as
  one it made itself would.
- Both read their own hand from the context of each decision, not from memory.
- The only state either keeps from its own earlier decisions is small, and empty is a valid value
  for it. The Cyborg's `plannedLead` (set when it bids) and `cashingSuit` (set when it leads a
  cash) are both cleared at every round start, so after a takeover they are what they would be at
  the start of a round.
- `CyborgStrategy::setSeat()` already says it is "the way to register a Cyborg that is watching a
  seat it does not occupy".

The stateless strategies (Random, First card, Low risk, Ducking) decide from the context alone and
need nothing.

**Work:**

- **Promise it.** A README section, "A strategy for a seat it does not play", and the same sentence
  on `ReckonerStrategy::setSeat()`.
- **Pin it** in a new `tests/StandbyTests.cpp`. For the Cyborg and each Reckoner preset: many
  seeded games in which seat k is played by another strategy while a stand-in watches it, and at a
  random decision the stand-in takes the seat over for the rest of the game. Every answer must be
  legal (`isBetLegal()`, the legal set), every game must finish, and the Cyborg's
  `getFallbacksTaken()` must stay 0, which says its memory agreed with every position it was shown.
  Cover a takeover during bidding, at a trick's lead, mid-trick, and in a Forehead and a Hidden
  round.
- **Optional:** make `ReckonerStrategy::onGameStarted()` refuse a name that matches no seat, as the
  Cyborg's does. Today it plays as seat 0, which the Cyborg's comment points out. The server does
  not need this, because it always calls `setSeat()`.

### 3.3 E3 (optional): an Emscripten build in CI

Only phase 10 needs the engine compiled to WebAssembly. A CI job that builds the engine and its
tests with Emscripten and runs them under Node would keep it portable in the meantime. It is cheap
insurance, and safe to skip if phase 10 is not wanted. Two things to know: C++ exceptions need a
compiler flag under Emscripten (`-fexceptions` or `-fwasm-exceptions`), and the Reckoner's exact
score test is already GCC-only (see the README).

### 3.4 What the engine does not need

- **A non-blocking `playStep()`.** It would remove the thread per game, and the need for JSPI in
  phase 10. `GameEngine.h` notes that the round loop keeps its state in members precisely so that
  adding one would be an additive change. It is not needed: a parked thread per table is cheap at
  this scale ([§4.10](#410-capacity)). Revisit if tables ever number in the thousands.
- **Saving and restoring a game.** A server restart ends the games in progress. Phase 11 recovers
  them without changing the engine, by replaying a log: the engine is deterministic given the
  shuffle seed and the decisions.
- **An API for replacing a seat's player.** Replacement happens inside the server's move provider;
  the engine sees one provider per seat, as always.
- **JSON, networking, player profiles.** The engine stays free of dependencies.

---

## 4. The server

### 4.1 One server for both modes

Solo games run on the server too, as a private table with one human seat. That gives one code
path and one protocol, and the page cannot tell the modes apart. The costs: a solo game needs a
connection, and a server restart ends it. Phases 10 and 11 deal with those, if they turn out to
matter.

Running the engine in the browser for solo games (WebAssembly) stays possible as phase 10. The
server's session code is written against two small seams, a transport and a way to wait, so it
can be compiled for a Web Worker without touching the game logic.

### 4.2 Why Drogon, and what it does not do

Why:

- **It is C++ and CMake.** The server links the engine and the session code directly, with no
  bindings and no second language on the server.
- **One library** covers WebSockets, static files, a JSON configuration file, signal handling and
  timers. It is MIT-licensed and maintained (1.9.14, 12 October 2026).
- **`WebSocketConnection::send()` may be called from any thread.** Drogon's network layer,
  trantor, queues the write onto the connection's own I/O thread, so a game thread sends directly.

What it does not do: Drogon's strength is asynchronous I/O and coroutines, and the engine is
synchronous. `run()` blocks inside a move provider while a human thinks. So each game runs on a
thread the server owns, outside Drogon's event loops, and Drogon only carries messages. Any C++
WebSocket server would do the same job; Drogon is the one with the fewest pieces to add.

Pin Drogon 1.9.14 as a git submodule (`libs/drogon`, trantor inside it) and build it with the
project, with its optional parts off: the ORM and database drivers, `drogon_ctl`, the examples.
Check the option names in its `CMakeLists.txt` at the pinned tag. The Ubuntu 24.04 package is
1.8.7, from 2023, too old to pin a new project to. System packages it needs:
`libjsoncpp-dev uuid-dev zlib1g-dev libssl-dev`.

### 4.3 Repository layout

The `server/core` line matters most: everything that decides anything lives where a test can
reach it without a socket.

### 4.4 The objects

| Object | One per | Does |
|---|---|---|
| `Registry` | server | Finds tables by code and members by token; runs the reaper ([§4.9](#49-a-tables-life)) |
| `Table` | table | Holds the settings, seats, members and host, the table's state (Lobby, Playing, Finished, Closed) and the current `GameRun` |
| `Member` | person at a table | Holds a token, a profile (name, gender, portrait), a seat, and the current connection, held weakly |
| `GameRun` | game | Owns the engine, the seat drivers, the publisher and the game thread |
| `SeatDriver` | seat | Asked for moves on the game thread, answered from I/O threads. Owns the seat's computer player and, for a human seat, the link to its human: prompt, deadline, presence |
| `SeatProvider` | seat | What the engine holds: ten lines that forward to the `SeatDriver` (the desktop client's `SeatProvider`, for the same reason, [§4.5](#45-lifetimes-and-declaration-order)) |
| `Publisher` | game | The engine observer. Builds a snapshot per viewer, sends events, paces the game, runs the round hold, and caches what a reconnecting viewer needs |
| `Outbox` | server | `send(member, json)`. Finds the member's live connection and drops the message if there is none. Tests use an in-memory `Outbox` that records everything |

### 4.5 Lifetimes and declaration order

The engine owns its move providers and destroys them on the game thread. So, as the desktop client
does (`QtMoveProvider.h`), the engine is handed `SeatProvider`s that own nothing, and `GameRun`
owns the real `SeatDriver`s.

`GameRun`'s members, in declaration order. Destruction runs in reverse, and the order is the
design:

1. The seat drivers, each owning its computer player, which is registered as an observer when it
   is one.
2. The publisher, also an observer.
3. The engine.
4. The thread (`std::jthread`), last, so that it is joined first. The engine, and everything it
   points at, outlive the thread that uses them.

Observers must outlive the engine (README); putting 1 and 2 before 3 is that rule.

### 4.6 Threads and locks

The threads:

- Drogon's I/O threads (two are plenty).
- Drogon's main loop, which runs the reaper's timer.
- One game thread per running game.
- One joiner thread, which joins finished game threads, so that no I/O thread ever waits on a join.

The rules:

1. **The engine is read only on its game thread**, inside callbacks and providers. Off that thread
   there is only what the publisher cached.
2. **I/O threads never wait for a game.** A message from a player takes the table's lock, updates
   state, calls `SeatDriver::submit()` (a mutex and a notify, like the desktop client's
   `QtMoveProvider::submit()`) and returns.
3. **A game thread never waits for an I/O thread.** It sends through the `Outbox`, which queues.
4. **Locks are taken in one order: `Registry`, then `Table`, then `SeatDriver`, then the
   publisher's cache.** Never the reverse. No lock is held while sending, while calling into the
   engine, or while a computer player decides.
5. **Every wait on a game thread has a deadline or a cancel.** The seat driver's wait has the turn
   timer, the grace period and abandonment. The publisher's pacing has cancellation and the round
   hold's timeout. The desktop client learned this with `GameBridge::setPaused()`: a wait with no
   deadline can be ended only by the cancel, so the closing path must cancel unconditionally.
6. **Game threads run at a lower priority than the I/O threads**, set with `setpriority` when the
   thread starts, so a table of Reckoners never makes the server slow to answer.

Shutting a game down, when a table closes or the server drains:

1. Mark the game as closing.
2. `abandon()` every seat driver. A parked one throws `GameAbandoned`, as the desktop client's
   does.
3. Cancel pacing, and call `requestStop()` for a game that is not parked.
4. Hand the thread to the joiner.

These are the two halves the README describes under "Abandoning a game whose provider is parked".

### 4.7 A seat's driver

Every seat has a `SeatDriver`. It holds:

- **A computer player.** For a computer seat, the strategy chosen for it; for a human seat, the
  table's replacement strategy. It is built before `start()`. When it is a Cyborg or a Reckoner, it
  gets `setSeat(Seat{i})` and is registered as an observer
  ([§3.2](#32-e2-strategies-standing-in-for-a-seat-they-do-not-play)), so it watches every game
  from the first deal.
- **For a human seat, the link:** the member; whether they are here, away or replaced
  ([§5.1](#51-words)); the turn timer; and how many moves in a row were made for them.

`makeBet()` and `playCard()`, on the game thread:

```
if the seat has no human, or its human is replaced:
    return the computer player's decision        (the publisher has already paced it)

build the prompt from the context: the hand in the engine's order, the legal indices,
    the forbidden bid, whether the round is blind
store it as pending, under a new generation number, and send it to the member
wait until one of: a valid answer for this generation | the deadline | abandonment

    answer        -> clear pending, reset the count of moves made for them, return it
    abandonment   -> throw GameAbandoned
    deadline      -> clear pending, tell the member the move was made for them,
                     return the computer player's decision;
                     mark the seat replaced if the member is away,
                     or if this was the third move in a row made for a connected member
```

The deadline is the earlier of the turn timer (online, while the member is connected) and the end
of the grace period (while they are away). Solo games have no turn timer and no replacement
([§5.4](#54-solo-is-different)).

Answers are untrusted. Port the desktop provider's checks, all of which `QtMoveProvider.cpp`
explains at length:

- **The generation gate.** A stale or doubled answer is dropped.
- **Range and legality.** The bid's range and the forbidden bid; the card's index and its
  legality. An invalid answer re-prompts instead of reaching the engine, which would throw out of
  `run()` and end the game. The deadline keeps running, so a client that sends nonsense for ever is
  answered by its computer player.
- **No lock while sending**, and the answer is cleared as it is taken, or the next prompt would
  return it without waiting.

### 4.8 Pacing, the round hold and pause

The publisher paces the game on the game thread, as `GameBridge::pace()` does: a beat before a
computer player's move, and a dwell on a finished trick and on a scored round. Port `Pacing` and
`newgame::pacingFor(botSpeed)` from the desktop client's `src/ui/NewGameDialog.cpp` unchanged: five
speeds, Slow to Instant. Give Instant a small floor on the server (some tens of milliseconds a
move) so that a watched game of computer players cannot keep a core busy for its whole length.

A computer player standing in for a human is paced as a computer player. Where the desktop client
asks `isHuman(seat)`, the server asks the seat driver whether a human is in charge right now.

- **Solo:** exactly the desktop client. The speed and "Wait for me after each round" come from the
  settings and can change mid-game. Pause holds the game for as long as it is on (cancel-safe,
  rule 5).
- **Online:** the speed is a table setting, fixed at the start. "Wait after each round" becomes
  the **round hold**: the round sheet stays up until every connected human has pressed Continue,
  or for 30 s, whichever comes first. There is no pause: one player could hold up everyone, and
  the round hold is the breather.
- **Animation speed** is not the server's business. It is each viewer's setting, applied by the
  page ([§8.4](#84-the-playback-queue)).

### 4.9 A table's life

```
Lobby ──start──> Playing ──last round scored──> Finished ──new game──> Playing ...
  │                 │                               │
  └─────────────────┴─────── reaper or host ───────┴──> Closed
```

- **Lobby.** Members join and choose seats and profiles; the host sets up the seats and settings
  and starts the game. If the host leaves, the human who has been there longest becomes host; if
  no human is left, the table closes after 10 minutes.
- **Playing.** One `GameRun`. While no human at the table is connected, the game holds (there is
  no point in computers playing for nobody). The table closes after 10 minutes unless someone
  returns.
- **Finished.** The standings are shown, and the host can start a new game with the same seats: a
  new `GameRun` at the same table, so nobody needs a new link.
- **The reaper** runs every few seconds on Drogon's main loop. It closes connections that have
  stopped answering pings ([§5.1](#51-words)), ends grace periods that nothing else would notice,
  closes idle tables, and hands finished threads to the joiner.

### 4.10 Capacity

These are estimates; phase 9 measures them.

- **A game thread spends its life parked, or asleep between beats.** CPU goes to the Reckoners. By
  their design document's estimates, the Gamma preset takes up to about 80 ms for a bid and 1 to
  60 ms for a card.
- **One game's cost.** A six-player 1-8-1 game is 32 rounds: about 190 bids and 700 cards. With
  six Gammas that is 15 to 20 s of CPU, over a game lasting 13 minutes or more at normal speed, so
  about 2% of one core.
- **Tables of humans cost almost nothing:** their stand-ins only watch.
- **What a small server runs.** A 2-vCPU server runs on the order of a hundred tables of
  Reckoners, and many more ordinary tables.
- **Memory** is thread stacks (reserved, barely touched) and kilobytes of game state.

Configure a maximum number of running games, rather than relying on the CPU running out first.

## 5. Drops, replacement and reconnection

### 5.1 Words

| Word | Means |
|---|---|
| **here** | The member's WebSocket is open and answering pings |
| **away** | The connection closed, or stopped answering pings for 30 s. The seat is still theirs |
| **grace period** | 30 s from going away. If their turn comes inside it, the table waits for them, and the others see a countdown |
| **replaced** | The grace period ran out, or they left, or the turn timer ran out three times in a row. Their seat's computer player makes their moves |
| **reclaimed** | They came back. The next decision is theirs again |

**Noticing a vanished connection.** The server pings every 10 s
(`WebSocketConnection::setPingMessage`) and records each pong. Drogon's connection passes pong
frames on to its message callback. A connection with no pong for 30 s is closed and counts as away.
Browsers answer pings below the page's JavaScript, so a tab in the background, whose timers the
browser slows down, still counts as here. Drogon's own idle timeout cannot do this job: the pings
are writes, and writes keep a connection active. Phase 1 checks that pongs reach the controller's
`handleNewMessage` at the pinned version.

### 5.2 Timelines

1. **A reload, or a short network blip.** Away, then back within 30 s. The others see "Ana is
   reconnecting…" for a moment; if Ana's turn came, the table waited.
2. **Gone for good, during someone else's turn.** Away, then replaced 30 s later; the others see
   "Computer playing for Ana". Her computer player makes every move from then on, and the game goes
   on.
3. **Gone during her own turn.** The table waits for what is left of the grace period. Then her
   computer player makes the move, and the seat is replaced.
4. **Here, but not playing** (a tab left open). The turn timer, 60 s by default, runs out, and her
   computer player makes that one move ("made for you"). Three in a row, and she is treated as gone
   ([timeline 2](#52-timelines)). Anything she then does reclaims the seat.
5. **Leaving on purpose** (Leave table). Replaced at once. Coming back by the same link reclaims
   the seat.
6. **Coming back after being replaced.** A sync ([§6.7](#67-resynchronising)), and the seat is
   hers again from the next decision. A decision her computer player is already making finishes
   first.

### 5.3 What the others see

- **Name panels show presence:** away, with the grace countdown when it is that player's turn;
  replaced, with a computer badge, and "Computer playing for Ana" in the trick panel; back.
- **Short notices** as toasts: "Ana left the table", "Ana is back".
- **Nothing else changes.** A replaced seat keeps its name, portrait and score. The stand-in's
  moves are the seat's moves.

### 5.4 Solo is different

Nobody else is waiting, so a solo game never replaces you. When you go away, the game holds where
it is, and goes on when you come back, for up to 30 minutes, after which the table closes. There is
no turn timer. A watched game of computer players holds in the same way when its watcher goes away:
it is a table with no human here.

### 5.5 Edge cases

- **An answer and a deadline at the same moment.** The seat driver's lock decides, and the
  generation gate drops the loser. The member is told which won (`promptClosed`).
- **The same token in two tabs.** The newer connection wins; the older one is told why and closed.
- **A human returns while their computer player is deciding.** The decision finishes; the human
  gets the next one.
- **The host goes away in the lobby.** The host role passes on when the grace period ends.
- **Every human away.** The game holds ([§4.9](#49-a-tables-life)).
- **A server restart.** Games in progress are lost until phase 11. Phase 9's drain makes restarts
  rare and announced.
- **Later: a newcomer taking a computer player's seat in a running game.** It is the same
  mechanism: attach a human link to a computer seat at a round boundary. It is not in the first
  version, partly because the newcomer would play under the seat's name (the engine fixes names at
  `start()`).

---

## 6. The protocol

### 6.1 Transport and envelope

- **One WebSocket per tab**, at `/ws`, carrying text frames that each hold one JSON object.
- **Every message has a `type`.** Server messages also carry `seq`, a number that increases per
  connection, for logs and tests.
- **Limits.** Messages from clients are capped at 4 KiB (`setClientMaxWebSocketMessageSize`) and
  rate-limited ([§9](#9-security-and-fairness)).
- **No sentences on the wire.** The server sends names, numbers and codes, and each page writes
  the text in its viewer's language. Errors are codes.
- **Words.** The protocol uses the engine's identifiers (`bet`, `betPlaced`); prose and the page
  say "bid", as the desktop client does.

### 6.2 Cards and hands

- **A card is two characters:** the rank `3`–`9`, `T`, `J`, `Q`, `K` or `A`, then the suit `H`,
  `D`, `S` or `C`. `"TH"` is the ten of hearts. The engine has a `Two`, but no deck uses it: the
  deck runs from the ace down, two ranks per player, so six players stop at the 3.
- **A hand is an array in the engine's order.** The page sorts it for display and remembers each
  card's place in the engine's order; that index is what a play sends back. The desktop client
  needed `PlayPrompt::handIndex` because it sorted on the game thread; sorting on the page makes
  that table unnecessary.

### 6.3 Client to server

| `type` | Fields | Allowed |
|---|---|---|
| `hello` | `protocol`, `token` (absent the first time), `lang` | First, and only first |
| `createSolo` | `settings` | Not at a table |
| `createTable` | `settings`, `profile` | Not at a table |
| `joinTable` | `code`, `profile` | Not at a table |
| `updateProfile` | `name`, `gender`, `avatar` | Lobby |
| `takeSeat` | `seat` | Lobby, an open seat |
| `setSeat` | `seat`, `kind` (`open` or `computer`), `level` | Host, lobby |
| `updateSettings` | `settings` | Host, lobby. Solo: speed and the wait at any time |
| `startGame` | – | Host, in the lobby or after a game |
| `bet` | `prompt`, `value` | Your own pending prompt |
| `play` | `prompt`, `index` | Your own pending prompt |
| `continue` | `round` | During the round hold |
| `pause`, `resume` | – | Solo |
| `leaveTable` | – | At a table |

### 6.4 Server to client

| `type` | Fields | To |
|---|---|---|
| `welcome` | `token`, `member`, `server` (`version`, `commit`) | The connection |
| `tableState` | `code`, `mode`, `state`, `host`, `settings`, `seats`, `waitingFor` | Everyone at the table, on every change |
| `game` | `game` (the game's number at the table), `event`, `snapshot` | Everyone, each with their own snapshot |
| `prompt` | [§6.6](#66-prompts-and-answers) | The seat's member |
| `promptClosed` | `id`, `by` (`you` or `computer`) | The seat's member |
| `held` | `round`, `waitingFor`, `deadline` | Everyone, during the round hold |
| `sync` | [§6.7](#67-resynchronising) | On joining or rejoining |
| `error` | `code`, sometimes `detail` | The connection |

**Events** follow the engine's thirteen callbacks one for one: `gameStarted`, `roundStarted`,
`betRequested {seat}`, `betPlaced {seat, bet}`, `bettingComplete`, `trickStarted {trick, leader}`,
`cardRequested {seat}`, `cardPlayed {seat, card}`, `trickWon {seat, trick}`, `roundScored {result}`,
`roundComplete`, `gameOver {standings, winners}`, `gameStopped`. `result` has the desktop client's
`RoundResult` shape. `standings` and `winners` are the engine's `Standing` rows: seat, name, score
and place.

**Computer players** are named as the catalogues name them: `random`, `first-card`, `low-risk`,
`ducking`, `cyborg`, `reckoner-alpha`, `reckoner-beta`, `reckoner-gamma`, `reckoner-delta`.

A `tableState` seat, one of each kind:

```json
{ "kind": "human", "name": "Ana", "gender": "female", "avatar": "woman-long-red-hair",
  "presence": "away", "you": false }
{ "kind": "computer", "level": "cyborg", "name": "T-800", "gender": "male",
  "avatar": "cyborg-man-eye" }
{ "kind": "open" }
```

`presence` is `here`, `away` or `replaced`. `waitingFor` is present while the table waits for an
away player's turn: `{ "seat": 2, "deadline": 23000 }`.

### 6.5 The snapshot

The engine's snapshot ([§3.1](#31-e1-a-snapshot-filtered-for-its-viewer)) for this viewer, as JSON,
plus `you`: the viewer's seat, or `null` for a watcher. A `game` message, six players, mid-trick,
seen from seat 0:

```json
{
  "type": "game", "seq": 812, "game": 1,
  "event": { "kind": "cardPlayed", "seat": 3, "card": "KH" },
  "snapshot": {
    "you": 0,
    "status": "inProgress", "phase": "playing",
    "round": { "index": 7, "count": 32, "type": "normal", "tricks": 3, "trick": 2,
               "trump": "7S", "leader": 2 },
    "active": 3,
    "forbiddenBet": null,
    "bets": { "placed": 6, "sum": 2 },
    "table": { "ledBy": 2, "leadSuit": "H",
               "cards": [ { "seat": 2, "card": "9H", "winning": false },
                          { "seat": 3, "card": "KH", "winning": true } ] },
    "seats": [
      { "name": "Dan", "bidOrder": 5, "bet": 0, "won": 0, "cards": 2, "roundScore": 0,
        "total": 41, "wins": 2, "losses": 0, "hand": ["AS", "TD"] },
      { "name": "Ana", "bidOrder": 6, "bet": 1, "won": 0, "cards": 2, "roundScore": 0,
        "total": 38, "wins": 0, "losses": 1 }
    ]
  }
}
```

The other four seats are cut for space. Only seat 0 has a `hand`. In a Forehead round, the other
seats would have one and seat 0 would not; in a Hidden round, nobody would. `cards` always says
how many backs to draw.

### 6.6 Prompts and answers

```json
{ "type": "prompt", "id": 57, "kind": "play", "deadline": 60000,
  "hand": ["AS", "TD"], "legal": [0], "blind": false }

{ "type": "play", "prompt": 57, "index": 0 }

{ "type": "prompt", "id": 58, "kind": "bet", "deadline": 60000,
  "hand": ["AS", "TD", "4C"], "max": 3, "forbidden": 1, "first": false, "roundType": "normal" }

{ "type": "bet", "prompt": 58, "value": 0 }
```

- **A prompt carries everything its answer needs:** the hand, the legal indices into it, the
  highest bid and the forbidden one. The page never has to consult a snapshot to answer.
- **In a Forehead or Hidden round** the prompt has no `hand`, only `handSize`. This follows the
  desktop client's rule that a prompt which never carries the hand cannot leak it.
- **`deadline` is milliseconds remaining when the prompt was sent**, or `null` when there is no
  timer. The page counts down from when it received it, so the two clocks never need to agree.

### 6.7 Resynchronising

A `hello` with a token that belongs to a live table is answered with a `sync`:

- the `tableState`;
- this viewer's latest snapshot, from the publisher's cache. At every callback the publisher
  caches the latest snapshot for each seat and for a watcher, so answering a sync never touches
  the engine;
- the round history so far, one `RoundResult` per scored round;
- the last finished trick, kept across rounds (the owner's call on the desktop client,
  2026-10-22);
- the pending prompt, if there is one, with the time left on it;
- the round hold, if one is on.

The page drops whatever it had queued and renders the sync.

### 6.8 Errors and versions

- **`hello.protocol` is a whole number.** The server serves its own page, so a mismatch can happen
  only across a deploy. The server answers `error {code: "version"}` and the page reloads itself
  once.
- **Codes:** `badMessage`, `version`, `notFound`, `tableFull`, `nameTaken`, `notHost`,
  `notYourTurn`, `stalePrompt`, `illegal`, `rateLimited`, `draining`. Several `badMessage` errors
  close the connection.

### 6.9 Keeping the two sides in step

- **`protocol/PROTOCOL.md` is the reference.** The TypeScript types in `web/src/net/protocol.ts`
  follow it by hand; it is small.
- **Contract fixtures.** Server tests write one real sample of every message to
  `protocol/fixtures/`, taken from real games, and page tests decode every fixture with the page's
  own decoder. A field renamed on one side fails the other side's tests.

## 7. Tables, seats and players

### 7.1 Solo

The desktop client's New Game, as a page:

- play or watch;
- the number of seats, and a computer player per seat (the nine);
- names, drawn from the catalogue and editable;
- the game's shape, and the Forehead and Hidden options;
- bot speed and "Wait for me after each round";
- a fixed deal (a seed).

Start goes straight to the table.

### 7.2 Online tables

- **Creating** takes the solo settings, without the seed and without watching, plus two more:
  - **the replacement computer player.** The default is Reckoner Beta: it has the best result in
    the engine's tournament tables (87.5 points a game against the Cyborg's 72.7, over 15 games)
    and costs less than Gamma or Delta;
  - **the turn timer:** 60 s by default, or off.
- **The creator is the host**, and gets a link, `https://<host>/t/K7QM4P`, and its code.
- **The lobby** shows the seats round the table. Each seat is open, a human (with presence), or a
  computer player (with its level). People who join take an open seat. The host can make a seat a
  computer player and choose its level, open it again, move people, change the settings, and
  change the number of seats (2 to 6).
- **Starting** needs every seat filled. The start button offers to give the open seats to computer
  players.

### 7.3 Names, genders and portraits

- **Humans** choose:
  - a name of 1 to 20 characters, the desktop client's limit;
  - a gender, which Romanian needs ("Ana e prima", "Bogdan e primul");
  - a portrait from the catalogue's entries for that gender, or for either, that are not dedicated
    to a strategy.
- **Names are unique at a table, compared without regard to case.** The engine requires names
  that differ byte for byte, and "Ana" next to "ana" would confuse everyone anyway. A clash gets a
  number ("Ana 2").
- **Cleaning.** Trim, normalise to NFC, and strip control characters and bidirectional overrides,
  which can make one name display as another.
- **Avoid "LowRisk" and "Ducking" in names.** `ReckonerStrategy::onGameStarted()` models a seat
  whose name contains either word as deterministic, so a human so named would be misread by every
  Reckoner at the table.
- **Computer players** get names and portraits by the desktop client's rules, from
  `player_names.json` and `avatars.json`: entries dedicated to the strategy first (the Cyborgs'
  names and faces), in the host's language.

### 7.4 Who may change what, and when

| Setting | Solo | Online |
|---|---|---|
| Seats, their kinds and levels; the game's shape; Forehead and Hidden | Before the start | Host, in the lobby |
| Bot speed | At any time | Host, in the lobby |
| "Wait for me after each round" / the round hold | At any time | Host, in the lobby |
| Seed | Before the start | Not offered |
| Replacement computer player, turn timer | Not used | Host, in the lobby |
| Animation speed, language | Each viewer, at any time | Each viewer, at any time |

---

## 8. The browser page

### 8.1 The look: the desktop client wins

**The page must look like the desktop client. Where the desktop client and the mock-up differ, the
desktop client wins, even when that means writing new code and throwing the mock-up's away.**
Decided by the owner, 2026-10-27.

The reference is the desktop client's current release, 2.0.0 as this is written; if its look
changes later, the page follows. The reference is never the mock-up, and never this plan's
description of either. It is the desktop client as it runs, and its source.

The mock-up is useful because the desktop client was built from it: most of its numbers and much of
its CSS are still the desktop client's. But the desktop client departed from it in many places over
the redesign's 13 phases, so the mock-up's code is reused only where it still matches:

1. **Before reusing any mock-up function, CSS rule or value, find the desktop code that draws the
   same thing and compare them.** [§8.6](#86-from-the-mock-ups-script)'s last column names that
   code for every part of the mock-up's script, and [§8.7](#87-from-the-desktop-client) for every
   part of the desktop client. Compare sizes, positions, colours, fonts, shadows, motion paths and
   timings, and wording.
2. **The same:** reuse it.
3. **Different:** write what the desktop client does, for the browser, however much of the
   mock-up's code that replaces and whatever it costs. Reuse is never a reason to keep a
   difference.
4. **What the mock-up does not have at all** comes from the desktop client alone: the main menu,
   New Game, the language dialog, pause, the final results, Forehead faces, the 2-player table.
5. **What neither has** is new, and is drawn in the desktop client's style, with its panels, colours
   and fonts (`src/paint/Theme.cpp`, `Panel.cpp`), never in the mock-up's: the online lobby, the
   connection and replacement notices, the turn countdown.

Some known departures, to show the kind. The desktop's redesign plan records them all, phase by
phase, and the desktop's source is the final word:

- Belleza for headings, because the mock-up's Marcellus has no ș or ț;
- the round logo on the table, with the played cards placed round it;
- the scoreboard's RUN column;
- the portraits, which are files;
- projective racks, where the mock-up tilts its fans with `rotateX`;
- the 2-player table;
- faces in the racks in a Forehead round;
- no toasts: the desktop client refuses an illegal card without one;
- every sheet.

**Only two kinds of difference may stay:**

- **Those the browser forces.** For example, Qt and Chrome space the same font slightly
  differently; the desktop's redesign plan found its scoreboard lines a pixel lower than the
  mock-up's for that reason.
- **Those the owner accepts**, named in a phase's outcome.

Each visual phase ends with side-by-side comparisons against the desktop client's own screenshots
([§10.5](#105-the-look)).

### 8.2 Technology

- **TypeScript, built with Vite, and no UI framework.** The table is a fixed design space scaled
  to the window, as in the desktop client, and the state arrives whole, so plain DOM and CSS are
  enough. They also let the mock-up's code be reused directly wherever it matches the desktop
  client. A framework would add a layer without removing any work.
- **CSS** for the look; the **Web Animations API** for motion, set to the desktop client's paths
  and timings; **CSS `matrix3d`** for the racks ([§8.7](#87-from-the-desktop-client)).
- **Vitest** for unit tests; **Playwright** for end-to-end tests and screenshots.

### 8.3 Code layout (`web/src`)

```
net/       the socket (connect, hello, reconnect with back-off), protocol types, the decoder
play/      the store (table state, snapshot, history, last trick, prompt), the playback queue
table/     stage scaling, seat geometry, name panels, racks, hand, trick, lead mark,
           scoreboard, trick panel, bid strip, bid bubbles
sheets/    round, history, last trick, final results, rules, settings, pause
lobby/     main menu, solo setup, create and join, the table's lobby
i18n/      t(), plural and gender helpers, the generated catalogues
dom/       element builders; text goes in only through textContent
assets/    the generated asset manifest (§8.8)
```

### 8.4 The playback queue

- **Every server message goes into one queue, handled in order.**
  - A `game` message animates its event (a card's flight, a trick swept to its winner, a bid
    bubble), then renders its snapshot.
  - A `prompt` becomes live when the queue reaches it.
  - A `sync` empties the queue.
- **Animation speed** is the viewer's setting: the desktop client's four stops, Off to Slow.
- **Falling behind.** When more than a few messages are waiting, the queue applies them without
  animation until it has caught up. This covers Instant bots, a slow device, and a tab coming back
  from the background.
- **Your own card moves as soon as you click.** The answer goes out, and the server's
  `cardPlayed` for your seat confirms it without animating it again. An error puts the card back,
  which should not happen, because the page offers only legal moves.
- **The countdown.** A prompt's deadline shows as a ring on your name panel for its last 15 s,
  counted from when the page received the prompt.

### 8.5 Rendering

- **Each element of the table is created once and updated in place** from each snapshot, keyed by
  seat and by card, so animations and keyboard focus survive the updates. The mock-up rebuilds
  everything with `innerHTML` on every change. That is fine for a mock-up, and wrong for a page with
  animations running and names typed by strangers.
- **Seats are turned so that the viewer sits at the bottom:** displayed seat = (seat − you + n)
  mod n. A watcher sees seat 0 at the bottom. The two dozen places where the mock-up assumes that
  you are seat 0 become "displayed seat 0".

### 8.6 From the mock-up's script

Line numbers are those of `docs/ui-redesign/mockup/source/table.js` in the desktop repository.

"Gone" and "Replaced" are about how the page is built. Everywhere else, the desktop client decides
what the page draws, by the procedure of [§8.1](#81-the-look-the-desktop-client-wins). The
mock-up's code survives only where it already matches the desktop source in the last column. Paths
in that column are in the desktop repository.

| Mock-up | Lines | In the page | Desktop source that decides |
|---|---|---|---|
| The rules: `scheduleFor` to `scoreRound` | 3–169 | **Gone.** The engine decides, and the page shows what it is told. Keeping any of it would give two sets of rules that can disagree | – |
| The bots and the demo game: `botBid`, `botPlay`, `autoRound`, `demoGame` | 171–240 | **Gone.** Fixtures ([§10.5](#105-the-look)) replace the demo's mid-game opening | – |
| `portrait()` | 251–270 | **Gone.** Portraits are the catalogue's files | `src/paint/Avatars.cpp` |
| `backSvg()`, the noise and grain, the textures | 271–291 | The textures are the desktop client's own files. The card back is ported from the desktop client's painted one. The grain is whatever the desktop's table top draws | `src/paint/CardRenderer.cpp`, `src/table/TableTopItem.cpp` |
| `fit()`, `toStage()` | 293–335 | The desktop client fits its fixed table to the window the same way, uniformly and centred, so the idea carries over. The numbers and the corner panels' places are the desktop client's | `src/table/TableView.cpp`, `src/table/TableSpace.cpp` |
| `LAYOUTS`, `trickPos`, `plaqueCenter`, `rackAngle` | 337–373 | The desktop client's numbers, which add the 2-player table and the played cards round the logo | `src/table/SeatLayout.cpp`, `src/table/TrickItem.cpp` |
| `buildSeats` | 379–423 | The seats' elements, created once ([§8.5](#85-rendering)), placed where the desktop client places them | `src/table/SeatLayout.cpp`, `src/table/RackItem.cpp` |
| `renderPlaques`, `pillFor` | 424–450 | Name panels with the portrait, name, Taken/Bid pill and turn ring, from `snapshot.seats`, plus presence from `tableState` | `src/table/SeatItem.cpp` |
| `renderFans` | 451–462 | Projective racks drawn with `matrix3d`: backs from `cards`, faces from `hand` in a Forehead round | `src/table/RackItem.cpp` |
| `renderHand`, `suitOrder` | 463–495 | Your `hand`, ordered and fanned as the desktop client does it; legality from the prompt | `src/table/HandItem.cpp`, `src/core/HandLayout.cpp`, `src/core/CardOrder.cpp` |
| `renderTrick`, with the lead mark | 496–538 | From `snapshot.table` (`winning`, `ledBy`), placed round the logo; the mark only while playing | `src/table/TrickItem.cpp`, `src/table/LeadMarkItem.cpp` |
| `renderScore` | 539–560 | Each seat's `bet`, `won` and `total`; RUN from `wins` and `losses`; `bets`; the trump | `src/table/ScoreboardItem.cpp` |
| `renderTrickInfo` | 561–601 | From the phase, `active`, the table and the prompt; the desktop client's sentences, from `t()`, with gender agreement | `src/table/TrickPanelItem.cpp`, `src/table/PersonText.cpp` |
| `bubble`, `animateIn`, `sweep`, `finishTrick` | 619–661 | The desktop client's motion, driven by events: its paths, timings, easing and fades | `src/table/Motion.cpp`, `src/table/BidBubbleItem.cpp` |
| `step()` | 662–702 | **Replaced** by the playback queue ([§8.4](#84-the-playback-queue)) | – |
| `humanPlay`, `showBidStrip`, `humanBid` | 703–747 | Send `play` or `bet` with the prompt's id. The bid strip comes from the prompt's `max` and `forbidden`, and is drawn as the desktop client draws it | `src/table/BidStripItem.cpp` |
| The sheets: `showRoundSheet` to `showSettings` | 749–829 | The desktop client's sheets and overlay, not the mock-up's modal: their layout, sizes, buttons and wording. The data comes from `roundScored`, the sync's history, the last trick and `gameOver` | `src/ui/Overlay.cpp`, `src/ui/*Sheet.cpp`, `src/ui/GameOverPanel.cpp` |
| `toast` | 831–839 | The desktop client has no toasts. The page still needs a notice for connection and replacement news: a new element in the desktop client's style ([§8.1](#81-the-look-the-desktop-client-wins), point 5) | `src/paint/Theme.cpp`, `src/paint/Panel.cpp` |
| The menu bar and the players switch | 872–886 | The desktop client's menu bar. The lobby replaces the switch | `src/ui/MenuBar.cpp` |

### 8.7 From the desktop client

Paths are in the desktop repository.

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| Fitting the fixed table to the window, uniformly and centred | `src/table/TableView.cpp`, `src/table/TableSpace.cpp` |
| Seat positions for 2 to 6 players, the corner panels | `src/table/SeatLayout.cpp`, `src/table/TableSpace.cpp` |
| The name panels: portrait, name, Taken/Bid pill, turn ring | `src/table/SeatItem.cpp` |
| The racks | `src/table/RackItem.cpp`. It maps each rack with `QTransform::quadToQuad`, a projective transform. A CSS `matrix3d` can hold the same 3×3 matrix (embedded in a 4×4), so port the quad maths and get the same racks exactly, instead of the mock-up's `rotateX` approximation |
| The hand: its fan, raised cards and dimmed ones, its order | `src/table/HandItem.cpp`, `src/core/HandLayout.cpp`, `src/core/CardOrder.cpp` |
| The played cards round the logo, the lead rhombus, the table top | `src/table/TrickItem.cpp`, `src/table/LeadMarkItem.cpp`, `src/table/TableTopItem.cpp` |
| The scoreboard with RUN, the trick panel | `src/table/ScoreboardItem.cpp`, `src/table/TrickPanelItem.cpp` |
| The bid strip and the bid bubbles | `src/table/BidStripItem.cpp`, `src/table/BidBubbleItem.cpp` |
| Colours, gradients, panels, shadows, fonts | `src/paint/Theme.cpp`, `Gradients.cpp`, `Panel.cpp`, `Shadows.cpp`, `Fonts.cpp` |
| The card back, which is painted, not a file | `src/paint/CardRenderer.cpp` (`back()`) |
| Motion and its pace | `src/table/Motion.cpp` |
| The sheets, the overlay, the menu bar, the main menu, New Game, the language dialog | `src/ui/` |
| Sentences about people, with Romanian agreement | `src/table/PersonText.cpp` |
| Every decision about the look, and why it was made | `docs/ui-redesign/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, each phase's outcome |

### 8.8 Assets

- **One import tool.** `tools/import_assets.py`, using Pillow as `build_mockup.py` does, takes the
  desktop repository's `resources/` at a given commit and writes the web versions:
  - the cards as WebP, at twice their largest size on screen;
  - the portraits and the table textures as WebP;
  - the fonts (Cinzel Decorative, Belleza, Alegreya Sans) as WOFF2, with their OFL licences;
  - `avatars.json` and `player_names.json`, copied;
  - a manifest that records the desktop commit.
- **The card back** is painted by the desktop client, not loaded from a file. Port it as an SVG.
- **Budget:** under about 2 MB for the first load. Portraits load as seats need them.

### 8.9 Languages

- **`t(context, source, args)` mirrors Qt's `translate()`**, so strings ported from the desktop
  client keep their wording.
- **One import tool.** `tools/import_ts.py` turns `i18n/romanian_whist_desktop_ro_RO.ts` (211
  strings, 8 with plural forms) into `en.json` and `ro.json`.
- **New strings**, for the lobby and the connection notices, are added by hand in both languages.
- **Plurals:** port Qt's own Romanian rule (three forms, one line) instead of using
  `Intl.PluralRules`. The two disagree on some numbers above 100 (101, for one), and Qt's rule is
  the one the reviewed translation was written against.
- **Gender agreement:** port `src/table/PersonText.cpp`.
- **Every string goes through `t()`** from the first phase of the page, even before Romanian
  arrives.

### 8.10 Keyboard, screen readers, touch and small screens

- **Keyboard:** the keys the desktop plan's §20 sets out. Digits bid and select, arrows move the
  selection, Enter commits, Space advances between tricks and rounds, and Esc closes a sheet.
- **Screen readers:**
  - every name panel and card is labelled with the accessible names of the desktop plan's §20
    ("Queen of spades, playable");
  - a polite live region announces moves ("Ana plays the queen of hearts");
  - colour is never the only cue (the desktop plan's §18): legal cards are lifted as well as lit,
    and winners are starred as well as highlighted.
- **Reduced motion:** treat `prefers-reduced-motion` as the desktop client's animation setting,
  Off.
- **Touch:**
  - the first tap selects a card, shown as the desktop client shows a card selected from the
    keyboard, and the second plays it, so a stray tap never plays;
  - controls are at least 44 px;
  - `touch-action: manipulation` on the table.
- **Small screens:** the table scales to fit, as the desktop client's does (`TableView.cpp`), and
  phones held sideways work. In the first version, a phone held upright gets a "turn your phone"
  hint.

---

## 9. Security and fairness

**Hidden information** (rules 1 and 2):

- The engine's viewer-filtered snapshot is the only thing that reads hands for the network.
  `grep -rn "getHand()" server/` should find nothing: the server sees hands only through the
  snapshot and the move contexts.
- A watcher never sees hands while humans play.
- Seeds never reach clients online, because a seed is the whole deal; solo players may set their
  own.
- The forbidden bid is public, since anyone can work it out from the bids.
- Stand-ins decide from their seat's own hand and the public play, as the engine's computer players
  always do.

**Untrusted input:**

- **Size and rate.** Messages are capped at 4 KiB. Each connection may send about 20 messages a
  second, with bursts to 40; beyond that it gets an error, then is closed.
- **Strict decoding.** Unknown types and unknown fields are rejected.
- **Every answer is checked** by its seat driver ([§4.7](#47-a-seats-driver)).

**Identity:**

- **The token** is 128 random bits (base64url), kept in the browser's storage and sent only in
  `hello`, never in a URL or a log.
- **One live connection per token.**
- **A join code** is six characters from an alphabet without look-alikes (about 30 bits), so
  failed joins are rate-limited per IP address, and tables expire.

**Limits:** connections per IP address (`setMaxConnectionNumPerIP`), tables created per IP address
per hour, a maximum number of running games, and members per table no more than its seats.

**The page:**

- Player-chosen text goes in only through `textContent`.
- A strict Content-Security-Policy: no inline script, and `connect-src 'self'`.
- Every asset is served by the server itself, so the page makes no third-party requests. That is
  also a privacy point.

**Fairness:**

- A timed-out move is made by the seat's computer player, never by a random card.
- The turn timer is long enough to cover the page's animations, and the page shows it.
- A stand-in plays to the seat's own bid, with the seat's own hand.

**Licence:** the engine is AGPL-3.0-or-later. A game server built on it must offer its users the
source of what is running (the licence's section 13). The page's footer links to the repository at
the exact commit the server was built from, served by `GET /version`
([§12](#12-deployment-and-operations)).

---

## 10. Testing

### 10.1 The engine (phase 0)

- **E1:** the pinned snapshots and the leak property
  ([§3.1](#31-e1-a-snapshot-filtered-for-its-viewer)).
- **E2:** the stand-in takeovers
  ([§3.2](#32-e2-strategies-standing-in-for-a-seat-they-do-not-play)).

### 10.2 The server's core

These are Catch2 tests against `server/core`, with no sockets. They use the in-memory `Outbox`,
timings set in milliseconds through configuration, and seeded games.

- A solo game played to the end by a scripted human; every message decodes.
- Invalid, stale and doubled answers are refused and re-prompted, and the game goes on.
- **The JSON leak scan.** For every message to every member, every card in it is one that member
  may see: their own hand when `canSeeHand()` allows, the cards on the table, the cards already
  played, the trump.
- Each timeline of [§5.2](#52-timelines), with short timings.
- An answer and a deadline at the same moment, repeated many times.
- Closing a table while a human is parked, while pacing, during the round hold, and while a
  Reckoner thinks. The thread joins within a second each time.
- Every human away: the game holds; one returns: it goes on; nobody returns: the table closes.
- A sync carries what a fresh viewer would get.
- A fixture is written for every message type ([§6.9](#69-keeping-the-two-sides-in-step)).

There is a `tsan` preset. Run it once at the end of each server phase, with the owner's go-ahead
([§11](#11-building-and-running-locally)).

### 10.3 The protocol

The contract fixtures of [§6.9](#69-keeping-the-two-sides-in-step).

### 10.4 End to end

- **Playwright**, headless Chromium, one worker:
  - a solo game;
  - an online game with three browser contexts;
  - a reload mid-trick;
  - a player who drops, is replaced, and comes back.
- **A chaos test:** a Node script with a dozen headless protocol clients that disconnect and
  reconnect at random, run in the background at low priority. It passes when every game finishes,
  no table stalls, and the leak scan, run again on the client side, finds nothing.

### 10.5 The look

- **The page renders from fixtures without a server**, so screens can be checked in any state.
- **A server-side tool plays the desktop client's `tests/ScreenshotTool.cpp` games**: the same
  seeds and players, to the same moments. It writes each viewer's snapshot as a fixture. The sheets
  get fixtures built by hand, as the screenshot tool builds theirs.
- **Playwright renders each fixture at the desktop shot's own size**: 1920×1080 for the
  whole-window shots, 1920×1034 for `table-empty`, the hands and the sheets. A script pairs each
  one with the desktop client's shot of the same name as `compare-<name>.png`, web on the left,
  desktop on the right, in a git-ignored folder.
- **Only the desktop client's pictures are a reference.** Never pair the page with the mock-up's
  pictures in `docs/ui-redesign/screenshots/`: they show what the desktop client departed from.
- **Each visual phase ends by linking these comparisons**, with a line or two on what matches and
  what still differs. This is the desktop repository's practice for its redesign phases.
- **Every difference that remains is one the browser forces or the owner has accepted**, and the
  phase's outcome names it ([§8.1](#81-the-look-the-desktop-client-wins)).

### 10.6 Load (phase 9)

- **Tables of six Reckoner Gammas**, at normal speed and at Instant.
- **Measured:** CPU per table, the time from a prompt being sent to it arriving, and memory.
- **The result sets the maximum number of running games.**

---

## 11. Building and running locally

**The owner's machine rules apply unchanged.** The section "Never freeze the owner's computer" in
the desktop repository's `CLAUDE.md` goes into the new repository's `CLAUDE.md`:

- builds as `nice -n 19 cmake --build <dir> -j 2`;
- tests under `nice -n 19`;
- one heavy command at a time, and long jobs in the background;
- timing runs, sanitizer builds, the chaos test and the load test only when the owner asks.

For the page:

- `nice -n 19 npx vitest run --maxWorkers=2`;
- `nice -n 19 npx playwright test --workers=1`.

The first build of each preset compiles Drogon too, which takes several minutes at `-j 2`, so run
it in the background.

**The owner's machine**, as checked on 2026-10-27, is Linux Mint 22.3, which is built on Ubuntu
24.04.

| Present | Missing |
|---|---|
| g++ 13.3, clang 18 | Emscripten (phase 10 only) |
| CMake 3.28 | Caddy (deployment only) |
| Node 24, npm 11 | |
| Python 3.12, with Pillow | |

Drogon's system packages are listed in [§4.2](#42-why-drogon-and-what-it-does-not-do).

- **Presets:** `default` (Debug), `release`, `clang` and `asan`, as in the desktop client, plus
  `tsan`.
- **Day to day:** the Vite dev server (port 5173) passes `/ws` through to the server (port 8080).
  Or the server serves `web/dist` itself, as it does in production.
- **CI:** one Linux job, which builds the server with a fixed job count (as the desktop client's CI
  does, never an unlimited `-j`), runs the core tests, builds the page and runs its unit tests.
  End-to-end tests and screenshots run locally, at the end of a phase.
- **Pull requests:** change a PR's title or description with
  `gh api -X PATCH repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<N> -F body=@<file>`. `gh pr edit` fails on the
  owner's repositories with a "Projects (classic)" GraphQL error.

---

## 12. Deployment and operations

- **A small Linux server:** 2 vCPUs and 2–4 GB, Debian or Ubuntu LTS. The server runs as a release
  build, with `web/dist` as Drogon's document root and one configuration file.
- **Caddy in front** gives HTTPS automatically. `reverse_proxy localhost:8080` passes WebSockets
  through as they are. Drogon listens on localhost only.
- **A systemd unit** restarts the server if it fails and raises its file limit. Logs go to the
  journal.
- **A drain on SIGTERM** (`app().setTermSignalHandler`):
  1. refuse new tables;
  2. tell everyone the server is restarting;
  3. wait for running games to end, or for at most 15 minutes;
  4. quit.

  Deploys wait for a quiet moment.
- **Health:**
  - `GET /health` (`app().registerHandler`), for uptime monitoring;
  - one log line a minute with counters: connections, tables by state, game threads, moves made by
    stand-ins, CPU.
- **The licence:** `GET /version` gives the commit, and the page's footer links "Source" to the
  repository at that commit, which covers the AGPL's section 13 for the server and the engine.
- **Privacy:** no accounts and no cookies, only a chosen display name and a random token in the
  browser's storage. An About page says so.

---

## 13. Phases

Each phase is a branch and a pull request. Its outcome is written under it when it closes: what was
built, what the owner decided, and where the build departed from this plan. Sizes are relative: S,
M, L.

After phase 3, the page (phases 6–8) can be built against fixtures while phases 4 and 5 go on in
the server.

### Phase 0: engine groundwork (this repository) — M

- **Work:** E1 and E2 (§3.1, §3.2); E3 if phase 10 is wanted. README and CHANGELOG. Release 5.1.0.
- **Done when:** the pinned snapshots, the leak property and the stand-in tests pass on CI on all
  three platforms.

### Phase 1: skeleton — S

- **Work:**
  - the new repository, with its licence, `CLAUDE.md`, both submodules, the presets, Catch2, and
    a Vite project;
  - CI;
  - Drogon serving a static page and a WebSocket echo at `/ws`.
- **Spikes to settle what this plan assumes about Drogon:**
  - a send from a non-I/O thread;
  - pongs reaching `handleNewMessage`;
  - the client message size cap;
  - the SIGTERM handler.
- **Done when:** it builds and tests under the machine rules, the page loads from the server, the
  echo works, and the four spikes behave as [§4.2](#42-why-drogon-and-what-it-does-not-do) and
  [§5.1](#51-words) assume. Where they do not, this plan is amended.

### Phase 2: the server's core — L

- **Work:** `Registry`, `Table`, `GameRun`, `SeatDriver`, `Publisher` and `Outbox` in
  `server/core`; the JSON encoding of every message; the fixtures.
- **Done when:**
  - a solo game runs headless to the end with a scripted human;
  - bad answers re-prompt;
  - abandonment joins the thread;
  - the JSON leak scan passes;
  - the core tests pass, and one `tsan` run does too.

### Phase 3: solo, end to end — M

- **Work:**
  - the Drogon controller over the core: `hello`, tokens, `createSolo`, prompts, answers, `sync`;
  - pause, and settings changed mid-game;
  - a plain debug page: the snapshot as text, buttons for the legal bids and cards.
- **Done when:**
  - a whole solo game can be played in a browser;
  - a reload mid-trick resumes it;
  - a watched game of computer players runs to the end.

### Phase 4: online tables — M

- **Work:** create, join, the lobby, seats, profiles, host controls, start; the round hold;
  `tableState`; names and portraits by the catalogues' rules.
- **Done when:** three browsers and three computer players finish a game together.

### Phase 5: drops and replacement — M

- **Work:**
  - here, away, replaced and reclaimed, with pong-based detection;
  - the turn timer, `promptClosed`, Leave table;
  - the hold when every human is away;
  - the reaper.
- **Done when:**
  - every timeline of [§5.2](#52-timelines) passes as a core test;
  - the chaos test, run for an hour of games, finishes every game with no table stalled.

### Phase 6: the table page — L

- **Work:**
  - the stage and seat geometry, name panels, racks, hand, played cards, lead mark, scoreboard,
    trick panel, bid strip and bid bubbles;
  - the playback queue;
  - rendering from fixtures;
  - `t()` everywhere, English only so far;
  - every element ported from its desktop source ([§8.6](#86-from-the-mock-ups-script)'s last
    column), with the mock-up's code kept only where it matches
    ([§8.1](#81-the-look-the-desktop-client-wins)).
- **Done when:**
  - the comparisons with the desktop client's `table-3-players` to `table-6-players`, `bidding`,
    `table-empty` and `hand-*` shots are linked;
  - no difference from the desktop client remains that the browser does not force or the owner
    has not accepted;
  - the owner approves.

### Phase 7: sheets and menus — L

- **Work:**
  - the round sheet, history, last trick, final results, rules, settings and pause, as the
    desktop client's overlay and sheets draw them, not the mock-up's modal;
  - the main menu and solo setup, as the desktop client's main menu and New Game;
  - the online lobby and its screens, which neither client has, in the desktop client's style
    ([§8.1](#81-the-look-the-desktop-client-wins), point 5);
  - the menu bar.
- **Done when:**
  - the comparisons with the `sheet-*` and `menu` shots are linked;
  - no difference from the desktop client remains that the browser does not force or the owner
    has not accepted;
  - everything in [§2.1](#21-carried-over-from-the-desktop-client) works in solo play.

### Phase 8: Romanian, keyboard, touch — M

- **Work:**
  - the imported translations, the new strings in Romanian, gender agreement and plurals;
  - keyboard play, the live region, touch, small screens.
- **Done when:**
  - the owner has reviewed the Romanian;
  - a game can be played with the keyboard alone;
  - a phone held sideways finishes a game.

### Phase 9: hardening and deployment — M

- **Work:**
  - the limits and rate limits, the Content-Security-Policy;
  - the drain, `/health`, `/version` and the source link;
  - the load test;
  - the server, Caddy, systemd, a domain.
- **Done when:**
  - it is deployed;
  - the load test has set the running-game cap;
  - a restart drains cleanly.

### Phase 10 (optional): offline solo — M to L

- **Work:**
  - `server/core`, without Drogon, compiled with Emscripten and run in a Web Worker. The seat
    driver's wait becomes an awaited message from the page, using JSPI (Chrome and Edge 137+,
    Firefox 153+, Safari 27+), with Asyncify as the fallback for other browsers (about 50% larger
    code, and its handling of virtual calls needs tuning);
  - the same protocol, over `postMessage`;
  - a service worker that caches the page.
- **Done when:** a solo game finishes with the network off.

### Phase 11 (optional): game records and recovery — M

- **Work:**
  - log each game's shuffle seed and every decision, as it happens;
  - after a restart, rebuild each game: replay its decisions with the observers silenced, then go
    on live. Stand-ins rebuild their memory by watching the replay, as they would watch a live game;
  - game records to download.
- **Done when:** after `kill -9` mid-game and a restart, every game resumes where it was.

## 14. Risks

| Risk | What keeps it small |
|---|---|
| A card reaches a player who may not see it | The engine's viewer-filtered snapshot is the only reader of hands (E1). The engine's leak property and the server's JSON scan |
| A deadlock or a race between game and I/O threads | The desktop client's patterns, ported; one lock order ([§4.6](#46-threads-and-locks)); `tsan` runs; the chaos test |
| A table stalls on a wait with no way out | Every wait has a deadline or a cancel (rule 4), with a test for each, and a log line when a wait outlives its deadline |
| A stand-in plays badly after taking over mid-round | Phase 0's stand-in tests: legal moves, and no Cyborg fallbacks |
| A restart loses games | The drain (phase 9), and recovery by replay (phase 11) |
| Mock-up code kept where the desktop client differs | The check of [§8.1](#81-the-look-the-desktop-client-wins) before any reuse; [§8.6](#86-from-the-mock-ups-script)'s last column; comparisons only against the desktop client's pictures |
| The look takes longer than planned, because more of the mock-up's code has to be replaced than hoped | Expected, and never a reason to keep a difference ([§8.1](#81-the-look-the-desktop-client-wins)); phases 6 and 7 are sized L for it. Port the desktop client's geometry and numbers, not Qt's mechanisms. Fixtures, and comparisons in every visual phase |
| Reckoners load a small server | The running-game cap, the lower thread priority, and the measurements of phase 9 |
| Abuse: floods of tables or messages | The limits of [§9](#9-security-and-fairness) |
| Silent disconnects | Detection by pong, checked in phase 1 |
| Names that spoof or inject | Text-only rendering, the Content-Security-Policy, the name rules of [§7.3](#73-names-genders-and-portraits) |
| Drogon behaves differently from what this plan assumes | Phase 1's spikes, before anything depends on them |

---

## 15. Decisions, with defaults

The plan assumes each default until the owner decides otherwise.

| # | Question | Default |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | Where do solo games run? | On the server. Offline in the browser later (phase 10) |
| D2 | Where does the web client's code live? | A new repository, `romanian_whist_web` |
| D3 | Which Drogon? | 1.9.14, as a submodule built with the project |
| D4 | Which JSON library? | jsoncpp, which Drogon already uses |
| D5 | What is the page built with? | TypeScript and Vite, no UI framework |
| D6 | Accounts? | None: a display name and a token in the browser |
| D7 | How are tables found? | By link or code only; no public list |
| D8 | How long is the grace period? | 30 s |
| D9 | The online turn timer? | 60 s, and three timed-out moves in a row count as a drop. The host may turn it off |
| D10 | Which computer player replaces a human? | The host chooses; Reckoner Beta by default |
| D11 | When does a returning player get the seat back? | At once, from the next decision |
| D12 | The online round hold? | Until every connected human presses Continue, at most 30 s |
| D13 | Pause in online games? | No |
| D14 | Phones? | Held sideways: yes. Held upright: later |
| D15 | Spectators at others' tables? | Later, and never seeing hands while humans play |
| D16 | Seeds in online games? | Not offered |
| D17 | A solo player who goes away? | The game holds for up to 30 minutes |
| D18 | Which look? | **Decided by the owner, 2026-10-27:** the desktop client. Where it and the mock-up differ, the desktop client wins, even when that means new code instead of the mock-up's ([§8.1](#81-the-look-the-desktop-client-wins)) |
| D19 | Chat? | None |
| D20 | Hosting? | One small server, with Caddy and systemd |
